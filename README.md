# Getting Started with the Headlesshost sample React app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

1. Install Node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org)

2. From the windows command prompt or mac/linux terminal, ensure node is installed correctly and is at versions 14.0.0 or greater.

3. For example:

```sh
> node -v
> v.18.5.0
```

_Note: The application will not run on a node version less than 14.0.0_

## Steps

1. Download the source files (either clone via git or download the compressed folder).

2. If in a zip file, extract the contents.

3. From the windows command prompt or mac/linux terminal navigate to to root folder (this should contain the package.json file).

4. Install the packages:

```sh
> npm install
```

5. Run the application:

```sh
> npm start
```

6. If everything is successful then a web page will be opened displaying the sample content.
